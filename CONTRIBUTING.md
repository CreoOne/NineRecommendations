# 9Recommendations source code contribution guidelines

In order to make this project clean and always ready for changes, appropriate measures need to take place when contributing.

1. Make sure new implementation is always hidden behind interface to enable ease of testing and functionality extension. Healthy separation and isolation is a requirement. Prevents unnecessary buildup of technical debt.
2. Apply as many layers of testing as reasonable. First point should make it easy. It is ok to sacrifice hermetization for testability.
3. Always think about future changes that can occur and pay attention how your contributions can make an impact on the whole project. Is your contribution enabling more changes or blocking them?

When in doubt, ask in issues of the project or just annotate on Pull Request.
Thanks for Your contributions!
